# SimpleEquationTool-Java-Practice
The user can make a simple equation entering three numbers and two operators. 

This is a review using while loops and a scanner. We let the user enter numbers and operators to make an equation.
We make sure each input is valid, if not we ask the user to try again!
After the math is done the app will close. In the future we can add a menu option in case the user wants to 
use the app again! We could also set up cases for how long the euqation should be, more numbers or more operators.
